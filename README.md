# MVA_ObjectReco_SinGAN
Final Project about the generative adversial model SinGAN for the course Object Recognition and Computer Vision (MVA).



We use SinGAN, an unconditional generative model in- troduced by T.R.Shaham and al in [1], for transferring drawings to photo-realistic images. We trained SinGAN on several pictures of buildings. For each training example, we designed one or more paintings in order to test the ability of SinGAN to reproduce realistic images. We demonstrated that SinGAN preserves the main structure of the drawing but often fails to recreate all details in a realistic way unless the painting is an accurate representation of the input. SinGAN has also been compared to another well known model, the Neural Style transfer method. Two quantitative tools have been used to distinguish them and we showed that the out- puts share great similarities.
